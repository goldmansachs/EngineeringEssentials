     * Create a DELETE method called cancelEvent() that will update the events to cancel all events with a given

     *
     * The Event Cancelled was a Baseball game where China is the Home Country and Australia is the Away Country

     * Return either a 200 OK or a 500 Internal Server error if it fails to delete an event
     * Return the list of cancelled events in the entity.
     *
     * Compare the remaining-events.json file to events.json file to check that the proper events were deleted
