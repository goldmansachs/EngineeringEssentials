Extra features you can add to the Cards project...
* "Favorite" Cards: Add a star icon on all cards that allows you to click the star to "favorite" the card
* "Reply-to" Cards: Add a reply icon on all cards that, when clicked, opens a different form for responding
* More libraries: Think up some features for the app and use open source third party libraries from GitHub to implement them


Further topics to research...
* Fetch, Axios, jQuery -- figure out how to use at least one of these to make AJAX HTTP requests! You'll need to do this for your case study.
* React router -- can use this to add several pages to your application
* React lifecycle -- learn more about React's under the hood "magic" and places where you can inject additional logic
* Redux -- popular central datastore architecture, more useful for larger projects
* Boilerplate -- alternatives to create-react-app that you'll probably consider if you ever make your own React app
