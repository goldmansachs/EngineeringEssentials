/* Display a stock ticker that provides typeahead (aka autocomplete) capability.
 * This requires making an AJAX HTTP request (asynchronous JavaScript and XML request) to
 * your service and prefetching the list of all available stock tickers or making an async
 * query every time the input changes (AsyncTypeahead). If you don't have a route defined
 * in your services/API that returns all stock tickers as a JSON object, create one!
 *
 * You can use promises(axios),
 * fetch, jQuery...there are many libraries to help you do this. The data you will
 * receive will be in a JSON format.
 * https://hashnode.com/post/5-best-libraries-for-making-ajax-calls-in-react-cis8x5f7k0jl7th53z68s41k1
 * fetch: https://davidwalsh.name/fetch
 * axios: https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios (you will need to install this package)
 * jquery: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/ (you will need to install the jquery package)
 *
 * Feel free to choose among of the many open source options for your typeahead select box.
 * We recommend react-select or react-bootstrap-typeahead. react-boostrap-typeahead is included
 * in your package.json.
